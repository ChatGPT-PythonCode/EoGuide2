In the world of *Endless Online: Recharged*, your progression is defined by your base attributes. Choosing a class is the first major step in specializing your character's power.

**Starting the Journey**
Every adventurer begins as a Wanderer. This neutral starting point allows you to explore the world and gather your first few levels before committing to a specialized path.

Once you are lvl 20 you will be able to change your class.
