12. Walk to coordinate 56, 53 (you can see them when you turn on your minimap) in front of the shovel
13. The spot has already been dug up before, so go back to the Pirate
14. The Pirate said he dug up that spot many times, and blames himself for trusting Blackbeard
15. Go to Nostalgia
16. Go south 2 maps until you reach the pirate ship
17. Talk to Blackbeard
18. To prove you are a real pirate, here are the answers to his 3 questions:
Jolly Roger
A double share
Yes, it’s always open
He also mentions the treasure directions are reversed

If you don't want to spend boat tickets going to Nostalgia, alternatively, you can go south of the Castle to the Game Host NPC
20. You can warp to the arena and go south, or if you're walking from Aeven square, go 2 maps west of Aeven to reach the castle
21. Once you go back to Monkey Island, step on the tile at coordinates 29,13 behind the pyramid and on top of the fish bones
22. The treasure is 5 shiny coins and 108,000 xp
