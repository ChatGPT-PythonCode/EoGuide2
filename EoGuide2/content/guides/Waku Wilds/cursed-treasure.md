4. Go inside, and talk to the Hopeless Pirate
5. His pirate ship broke and needs a rescue off the island
6. For the dialogue:
   I’m Bumblefoot
   Famous Pirate Captain
   I found many treasures!
   Wait a second…
   Join my crew, matey!
   Let’s talk about the treasure
7. He will show you the map, which says:
   "Stand right of the unique pair that once carried the temple roof
8. The view on the temple is much better 20 steps east from this spot
9. From this point set yer course 16 steps south, then half as much to the west
10. And yer find yer treasure 4 steps toward the southern winds."
11. Walk to coordinate 56, 53 (you can see them when you turn on your minimap) in front of the shovel
12. The spot has already been dug up before, so go back to the Pirate
13. The Pirate said he dug up that spot many times, and blames himself for trusting Blackbeard
14. Go to Nostalgia
15. Go south 2 maps until you reach the pirate ship
16. Talk to Blackbeard
17. To prove you are a real pirate, here are the answers to his 3 questions:
   Jolly Roger
   A double share
   Yes, it’s always open
   He also mentions the treasure directions are reversed

   If you don't want to spend boat tickets going to Nostalgia, alternatively, you can go south of the Castle to the Game Host NPC
19. You can warp to the arena and go south, or if you're walking from Aeven square, go 2 maps west of Aeven to reach the castle
20. Once you go back to Monkey Island, step on the tile at coordinates 29,13 behind the pyramid and on top of the fish bones
21. The treasure is 5 shiny coins and 108,000 xp
